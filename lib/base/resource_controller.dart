/// A [RequestHandler] for performing CRUD operations on [Model] instances.
///
/// Instances of this class create and execute [Query]s based on [Request]'s they receive. This instances of this class effectively map a REST API call
/// directly to the database. For example, this [RequestHandler] handles an HTTP PUT request by executing an update [Query]; the path variable in the request
/// indicates the value of the primary key for the updated row and the HTTP request body are the values updated.
///
/// When routing to a [ResourceController], you must provide the following route pattern, where <name> can be any string:
///
///       router.route("/<name>/[:id]")
///
/// You may optionally use the static method [routePattern] to create this string for you.
///
/// The mapping for HTTP request to action is as follows:
///
///       GET /<name>/:id -> Fetch Object by ID
///       PUT /<name>/:id -> Update Object by ID, HTTP Request Body contains update values.
///       DELETE /<name>/:id -> Delete Object by ID
///       POST /<name> -> Create new Object, HTTP Request Body contains update values.
///       GET /<name> -> Fetch instances of Object
///
/// You may use this class without subclassing, but you may also subclass it to modify the executed [Query] prior to its execution or the returned [Response] based
/// on the [Query]'s results.
///
/// The HTTP response body is encoded according to [responseContentType].
///
/// GET requests with no path parameter can take extra query parameters to modify the request. The following are the available query parameters:
///
///       count (integer): restricts the number of objects fetched to count. By default, this is null, which means no restrictions.
///       offset (integer): offsets the fetch by offset amount of objects. By default, this is null, which means no offset.
///       pageBy (string): indicates the key in which to page by. See [QueryPage] for more information on paging. If this value is passed as part of the query, either pageAfter or pagePrior must also be passed, but only one of those.
///       pageAfter (string): indicates the page value and direction of the paging. pageBy must also be set. See [QueryPage] for more information.
///       pagePrior (string): indicates the page value and direction of the paging. pageBy must also be set. See [QueryPage] for more information.
///       sortBy (string): indicates the sort order. The syntax is 'sortBy=key,order' where key is a property of [ModelType] and order is either 'asc' or 'desc'. You may specify multiple sortBy parameters.
///
